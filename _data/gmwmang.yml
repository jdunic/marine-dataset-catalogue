name: Global Mangrove Watch Map of Mangroves

variable: Baseline map of mangroves for 2010

description: Geospatial information about mangrove extent with the primary objective to provide a baseline map of mangroves for 2010 using ALOS PALSAR and Landsat data, and changes from this baseline for eight epochs between 1996 and 2017 derived from JERS-1, ALOS, and ALOS-2. Annual maps are planned from 2018 and onwards.
